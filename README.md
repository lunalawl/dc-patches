> To install, first you must have your desired game installed as an *extracted folder* (not as a GoD!)
>
> Rename its `default.xex` to `default_vanilla.xex`, just as a backup in case you want to revert to vanilla
>
> Then just extract the .zip file and drag and drop its contents into the game folder
